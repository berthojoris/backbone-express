0.2.0 - in progress

Major release. Instead of mimicking `Bones`, which is a very server-side-biased approach, this release makes no assumptions about your application structure, vastly reduces the adjustments necessary to make a codebase `backbone-express`-compatible and makes sure that your codebase will continue to work as a pure client-side app without server-side backing after you've made it compatible.

As a (significant) convenience, this release also introduces precompilation, concatenation and minification of JavaScript and CSS resources.

0.1.0 - February 28, 2012

Initial backbone-express release. This release tries to stay as close to `Bones`, its forebear, as possible, focusing solely on simplifying the implementation and making it compatible with recent versions of node.js and jQuery.
